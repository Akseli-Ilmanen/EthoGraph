## Plot Settings


### Zooming

- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out both axes
- **Zoom horizontally**: Right-click (hold) drag horizontally to zoom in/out along the time axis
- **Zoom vertically**: Right-click (hold) drag vertically to zoom out along y-axis

- **Percentile limit**: The GUI has a data-aware zoom-limit, where you can't zoom further out on the x or y-axis, as there is valid data. However, if you have very large outliers, you may prefer not to see them within your limit. By adjusting the percentile limit (y-axis), you can control whether to limit your y-axis zoom to be 95%, 99% or all (100%) of your data.


### Axes 

Control x and y-axes limits

- **Auto-scale**: Automatically adjust Y-axis based on visible data. Helpful when switching between features (see video).
- **Fixed range**: Lock Y-axis to specific values for consistent viewing.
