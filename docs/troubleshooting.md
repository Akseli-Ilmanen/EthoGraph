# Troubleshooting

## Error Messages

1. If you run into a problem, I recommend `Ctrl + S` to save labels `.nc` file, and then restart the GUI. Generally recommended to save semi-regularly!
2. If you are starting a new project with different type of data, it may be helpful to click on the `Reset gui_settings.yaml` to avoid `KeyError`/`AttributeError`.
