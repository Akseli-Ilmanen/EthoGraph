# EthoGraph

**GUI for segmenting animal behaviour using transformer models and changepoint detection.**

EthoGraph is a graphical user interface (GUI) made for visualizing and segmenting multimodal times series behavioural data.

It is built upon the Python frameworks [Napari](https://www.napari.org), [PyQtGraph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/), and [Movement](https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev). The combination of Napari and PyQtGraph enables a fast, interactive and synchronised interface for videos and time series plots. The data backend builds upon the Movement library to conveniently index multi-dimensional data across trials,  individuals, keypoints, space, and time. 

The GUI (and this documentation) is still under development.
